# SUMMARY

The range of response frequencies for which spectral ordinates obtained from accelerograms may be considered reliable is limited by several factors, primary among them being the effects of filters that are routinely applied to remove noise from the records. Considerable attention has been focused on the low-frequency limit of the usable spectral ordinates because of various engineering applications requiring long-period spectral accelerations or displacements but only recently have rational approaches to selecting the high-frequency limit been proposed. Since there are applications for which the high-frequency spectral ordinates are important, the approaches to this issue presented in the recent studies are reviewed and their application to the ground-motion database from Europe and the Middle East is explored. On the basis of the results of these analyses, it is concluded that a large proportion of this dataset can be used to provide reliable estimates of response spectral ordinates at much shorter periods than may have previously been considered feasible.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Models for the prediction of response spectral ordinates are of fundamental importance for defining loads for earthquake-resistant design and for providing input to seismic risk analyses. The range of response periods for which these predictions have been provided has been largely predicated on consideration of the requirements in terms of engineering applications so that the range of natural vibration periods of structures is adequately covered. This has prompted considerable attention to be focused on the long-period part of the spectrum and determination of the maximum usable range of low-cut filtered records. In recent years there has been a pronounced trend to extend the predictions to longer periods in order to satisfy the requirements for engineering analyses of base-isolated structures, high-rise buildings and long-span bridges, as well as the input to direct displacement-based design [1]. The general approach adopted has been to define the maximum usable response period as some fraction of a low-cut filter [2].

There are also important reasons to obtain reliable estimates of spectral ordinates at very short periods, even if these are not of particular relevance to the analysis and design of buildings. The seismic design of structures, systems and components within nuclear power plants, many of which have high natural vibration frequencies, is one field of application where the short-period spectral

ordinates are of particular importance. The importance of high-frequency response is also increased when the vertical component of motion is of consideration, especially if the vertical spectrum is to be obtained through the use of vertical-to-horizontal spectral ratios to scale the horizontal response spectrum.

Another application for which high-frequency ordinates can be important, albeit indirectly, is the inversion of empirical ground-motion predictions to find equivalent stochastic parameters [3], which can then be used to apply host-to-target conversions to transport models from one region to another [4]. The stability of such inversions is improved if the response spectrum is defined in detail across a wide range of response frequencies, and in particular at high frequencies.

Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for response spectral accelerations have generally provided coefficients for the prediction of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and the spectral acceleration at a large number of response periods. The shortest period for which coefficients are presented has varied significantly among published models [5], but the reasons behind the selection of the minimum period (other than  $0.0\mathrm{s}$ , corresponding to PGA) is often not explicitly stated. In some cases the shortest period may have been chosen purely on the basis of the smallest value deemed to be of relevance to structural engineering. In other cases, the minimum period may have been inferred from the nature of the instruments that produced the record, since analogue accelerographs are generally incapable of capturing motions at frequencies equal to or greater than that of the transducer. For the SMA-1 accelerometer, for example, the instrument response distorts ground motion with frequencies of greater than about  $20\mathrm{Hz}$  [6]. Although procedures have been developed to apply corrections for the effect of the transducer frequency, it has been noted that their application will amplify both the high-frequency signal and noise [7]. Another factor that could limit the shortest usable period is the Nyquist frequency (the reciprocal of twice the time step of the acceleration points in the record), determined by the digitization process for analogue records and by the sampling rate for digital instruments. However, as demonstrated by various examples in this paper, the Nyquist frequency does play a role in determining the high-cut filter cut-off but it is not necessarily the high-frequency limit for oscillator response at very short spectral periods. Since the high-frequency oscillator response approaches the ground acceleration, the sample interval of strong-motion recording becomes immaterial for determining the shortest usable period unless the record was obtained on a very low-kappa site. For such a site the high-frequency ground components are rich and the sampling interval becomes critical for unraveling the high-frequency features of the recording. Thus the choice of high-cut filter cut-off may have some impact on reflecting these features on the high-frequency oscillator response.

The most common reason for fixing the lower period limit of the spectra, however, is the high-cut filter cut-off applied to the records. This is reflected in Table 1 of Douglas and Boore [8], which summarizes the shortest period covered by a number of GMPEs and the reasons, if any, provided for the selection of this value. In many cases, it seems that symmetry has been assumed in the effects of filter cut-offs at both high and low frequencies; it has been found that the spectral response is distorted at periods beyond some proportion (between 0.65 and 0.95, depending on the instrument type, recording site characteristics, and other factors) of the long-period filter cut-off [2]. Several studies have simply assumed that the same behavior can be expected in the vicinity of the high-frequency filter cut-off, with the consequence that large numbers of records are excluded from the regressions on spectral ordinates at both short and long periods (Figure 1). The models produced in the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project [10] clearly did not make this same assumption since despite the different high-frequency cut-offs applied to the records in the dataset [11], some of which were as low as  $10\mathrm{Hz}$  [8], the models were derived using the same number of records at all high frequencies up to and including  $100\mathrm{Hz}$  (Figure 2). However, the reason that it was decided that the high-frequency filter cut-off did not need to lead to any records being excluded has not been presented in the papers documenting the NGA models and their derivation.

Light has been shed on this problem, however, in a recent study by Douglas and Boore [8]. Using simulated accelerograms, with and without noise, they demonstrated that high-frequency response spectral ordinates are far less sensitive to the filter cut-off than long-period ordinates, largely as a result of the former being controlled by lower frequency motion as a result of the

highest frequency components of motion being attenuated at most sites, except those situated close to the source on very hard rock. Douglas and Boore [8] also recommend that if high-cut filters are applied to strong-motion accelerograms, the corner frequencies should be selected on a record-by-record basis, as was done in the NGA project.

In this study, we explore the usable high-frequency range of the current strong-motion dataset from Europe, the Middle East and the Mediterranean, in light of the findings and conclusions of Douglas and Boore [8]. The study also serves to test the generality of their conclusions when applied to large numbers of real accelerograms obtained from both analogue and digital instruments. The issue of the shortest usable period from European strong-motion records is particularly interesting since empirical GMPEs derived for application throughout the seismically active parts of this region have generally not provided coefficients for very short response periods. The shortest response period modeled by Ambraseys et al. [13] was  $0.1\mathrm{~s}$ ; more recent studies by Ambraseys et al. [14] and Akkar and Bommer [15, 16] have extended this to  $0.05\mathrm{~s}$ . The primary aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of extending the European ground-motion models to lower response periods.

# 2. HIGH-CUT FILTERING OF EUROPEAN STRONG-MOTION RECORDS

The work presented in this paper is based on the effort of processing a large databank of strong-motion accelerograms from Europe, the Middle East and the Mediterranean region. These data include the records compiled for the study of Ambraseys et al. [14], as used by Akkar and

Bommer [15, 16], from earthquakes of  $M_{\mathrm{w}}$  5 and greater, and the complementary data from smaller events compiled by Bommer et al. [17]. The database has been expanded for all magnitude ranges by the addition of the new Italian ITACA strong-motion database [18] and the recently compiled Turkish strong-motion database [19]. The distribution of the  $\sim 2800$  records in this database with respect to magnitude, distance, site classification and instrument type is presented in the final section of the paper, but apart from this no details of the database are presented since the statistics of the records are not the concern of this study.

Different approaches have been taken to the high-cut filtering of European strong-motion records in previous studies. Ambraseys et al. [13] applied a cut-off of  $25\mathrm{Hz}$  to all records, whereas in a later study Ambraseys et al. [14] used this cut-off only for analogue records and they applied cut-offs of  $50 - 100\mathrm{Hz}$  for digital accelerograms. Although the latter study selected low-cut corner frequencies individually for each record, in the former a cut-off of  $0.2\mathrm{Hz}$  was applied to all records. Akkar and Bommer [15] did not apply any high-cut filter to the records, mainly because their focus was primarily on longer period spectral displacements, for which individual low-cut filter parameters were carefully selected for each record [2]. In the present study, the same criteria and procedures used by Akkar and Bommer [2] are applied to determine the long-period filter parameters, which for the records common to the Akkar and Bommer [15] database remain unchanged. For the high-cut corner frequencies, the recommendation of Douglas and Boore [8] that these should be selected individually is followed.

For the selection of high-cut filter values, we made use of the high-frequency noise behavior discussed in Douglas and Boore [8], who identify a flat portion at the high-frequency end of Fourier amplitude spectrum (FAS) that is contrary to the expected high-frequency attenuation of ground acceleration, which is often assumed to be controlled by the high-frequency attenuation parameter referred to as kappa,  $\kappa$  [20]. We identified this flat portion at the high-frequency end of the FAS and removed it by choosing a high-cut filter value that we judge to be appropriate. The results of the implemented filtering procedure in the time and frequency domains are summarized by the

example in Figure 3. The first step is to apply a linear baseline adjustment, which in the case of digital recordings is the mean of the pre-event portion of the accelerometer and it simply eliminates any initial instability (d.c. offsets due to shifts arising from leveling problems, etc.). This leads to what is called the mean-removed record, as shown in the upper left plot of Figure 3. The upper right panel shows the band-pass filtered record with filter having  $f_{\mathrm{low - cut}} = 0.2\mathrm{Hz}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{high - cut}} = 55\mathrm{Hz}$ . The duration of the band-pass filtered record is longer than that of the mean-removed record because we use an acausal Butterworth filter, which requires zero pads at the beginning and at the end of the ground motion. The advantages of using acausal filtering are explained in Boore and Akkar [21] and Boore and Bommer [7]. The order of Butterworth filter is chosen so that the acausal filter decays as  $(f_c / f)^8$  where  $f$  is frequency and  $f_c$  stands for either  $f_{\mathrm{low - cut}}$  or  $f_{\mathrm{high - cut}}$ . The lower panel in Figure 3 shows the FAS of mean-removed and band-pass filtered record. Note the low- and high-frequency noises (continuously increasing low-frequency and flat high-frequency components after approximately 0.2 and  $55\mathrm{Hz}$ , respectively) in the mean-removed record, which are eliminated after the application of the band-pass filter.

Since filtering of accelerograms limits the usable frequency range, whenever the characteristics of a record suggest that filtering is not required, it should be avoided. At the long-period end of the spectrum, some researchers have concluded that filtering can be avoided and that it is sufficient to apply baseline adjustments [1, 22] although others have taken the view that low-cut filters are generally required, even if the cut-off can be set at rather long periods [23]. At the high-frequency end there are records, exclusively from digital accelerographs, where it would appear that no high-cut filter is required. A typical example for such a case is presented in Figure 4, which is of the same format as Figure 3. The FAS of the mean-removed record is sufficiently well-behaved at high frequencies to lead us to conclude that it is not necessary to apply high-cut filtering to this record (but we low-cut filtered this record with  $f_{\mathrm{low - cut}} = 0.08\mathrm{Hz}$  as is suggested from the low-frequency trends in the FAS of the mean-removed and filtered time series).

# 3. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Once all the accelerograms in the extended strong-motion database were band-pass, or in some cases only high-pass, filtered, the next stage was to select the usable period range for each record. At the long-period end, we apply the criteria established by Akkar and Bommer [2], but from the study of Douglas and Boore [8] it is clear that we cannot apply this approach symmetrically to the short-period limit. Before entering into considerations of the maximum usable response frequency of our filtered records, it may be useful to consider the oscillator response and its interaction with the frequency content of the excitation from the perspective of simple structural dynamics.

The oscillator response at a particular natural frequency  $f_{n}$  can be represented by the convolution expression given in Equation (1):

$$
R (i f, f _ {n}, \xi) = H (i f, f _ {n}, \xi) \times F (i f, f _ {\text {l o w - c u t}}, f _ {\text {h i g h - c u t}}) \times G (i f) \tag {1}
$$

In the above equation  $H(if, f_n, \xi)$  and  $F(if, f_{\mathrm{low - cut}}, f_{\mathrm{high - cut}})$  are the complex oscillator and bandpass filter transfer functions which are convolved with the complex ground motion  $G(if)$  to obtain the oscillator response  $R(if, f_n, \xi)$  at  $f_n$  in the frequency space. The parameter  $\xi$  in Equation (1) is the viscous damping ratio of the oscillator. The inverse Fourier transformation of  $R(if, f_n, \xi)$  is the time domain representation of the oscillator response,  $r(t, f_n, \xi)$ , and its absolute maximum will yield the spectral ordinate at natural frequency  $f_n$ . Figure 5 illustrates the significance of each term in Equation (1). We plotted the absolute value of each functional term in Equation (1) because their representation in the complex frequency domain would render our discussions unnecessarily complicated. The low- and high-frequency noise shown in the FAS of acceleration time series  $(G(f)$  in the first row) is removed by the application of band-pass digital filter. The filtered ground motion (shown as  $F \times G$  in the second row) is then subjected to the oscillator transfer function,

which can be considered as a frequency-dependent weighting function (or another filter), to obtain the oscillator response  $(R(f, f_n, \xi)$  in the third row). Note that the oscillator transfer function gives more weight to the ground-motion frequencies in the vicinity of  $f_n$  but it accounts for the entire frequency content of the filtered ground motion while calculating the oscillator response at  $f_n$ . Based on this simple theory, the filter influence on spectral ordinates should be described by considering the interaction between the oscillator and filter transfer functions together with the frequency content of the ground motion.

The specific examples in the following section that are tailored for the high-cut filtering influence consider constant viscous damping  $(\xi = 5\%)$ . Moreover, we describe the oscillator response through relative displacement consistent with the above theoretical background. Given the oscillator frequency  $f_{n}$ , the absolute maximum of peak oscillator displacement is the spectral displacement  $(\mathrm{SD}(f_n,\xi))$  and its product with the square of circular natural frequency (i.e.  $\omega_{n}^{2} = 4\pi^{2}f_{n}^{2}$ ) yields the pseudo-spectral acceleration  $(\mathrm{PSA}(f_n,\xi))$  that is, for all practical purposes, of greater concern in the current engineering practice. However, as explained here, these spectral quantities are related to each other and discussing the high-cut filtering issue through oscillator displacements is simply a matter of the scaling factor.

# 4. CASE STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL RECORDS

To assess the degree of influence of the high-cut filter on the short-period spectral ordinates, we use the ratio of the filtered spectral ordinates to those from the mean-removed record, following the criteria used by Akkar and Bommer [2] for the long-period ordinates. Where this ratio is significantly different from 1 (and particularly if much less than unity) it can be concluded that the high-cut filter has exerted a pronounced influence on the spectral accelerations. One could argue for a different approach in which it is assumed that the usable high-frequency range is increased by removing high-frequency noise through filtering, but this requires several assumptions regarding the nature of the actual signal and some confidence that the noise can be isolated and removed. We believe that although we can select filter parameters on the basis of the expected behaviour of the FAS at high frequencies, in the absence of knowledge of the true ground motion, the approach of comparing filtered and mean-removed response spectral amplitudes provides a practical and versatile tool for assessing the influence of the high-cut filter. We focus on short response periods between 0.01 and  $0.05\mathrm{s}$ , since this is the range into which we would like to extend the European ground-motion prediction models. The following examples illustrate the different types of behavior observed, namely those where the high-frequency ordinates are rather insensitive to the high-cut filter, which is the most common case, and the exceptions where the high-cut filter has a very marked effect on the short-period spectral ordinates.

Figure 6. Left: FAS of mean-removed (black) and band-pass filtered (light gray) versions of the EW component of the Gebze-Arçelik station recording of the Düzce, Turkey, aftershock of 11 November 1999. Right: The Fourier amplitude components of the response of a  $50\mathrm{Hz}$  oscillator subject to the mean-removed (black) and band-pass filtered (light gray) records.

The first case is presented in Figure 6, which is a recording from an earthquake of  $M_{\mathrm{w}}$  5.9 obtained at a stiff soil site located at  $75\mathrm{km}$  from the source. The Nyquist frequency of the record is  $100\mathrm{Hz}$  and we applied a band-pass filtering between  $0.15\mathrm{Hz}$  ( $f_{\mathrm{low-cut}}$ ) and  $50\mathrm{Hz}$  ( $f_{\mathrm{high-cut}}$ ) to remove the noise, as can be observed from FAS in the left-hand panel of the figure. We consider the response of an oscillator with a natural frequency equal to the filter cut-off, namely  $50\mathrm{Hz}$  (i.e.  $T_{n} = 0.02\mathrm{s}$ ), where it is found that the spectral ratio of filtered to mean-removed records is 1. In order to explore why this might be the case, we calculate the absolute Fourier components (or briefly Fourier components) of the relative displacement of the oscillator response (i.e.  $R(f, f_{n}, \xi)$ ), which are shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 6 for both the mean-removed and filtered accelerograms. In both cases it can be seen that the maximum frequency components of the response are in the range  $5 - 7\mathrm{Hz}$ , where the amplitudes are higher even than the locally amplified ordinates at the oscillator frequency of  $50\mathrm{Hz}$ . This is interpreted as implying that the response of this oscillator is driven by the Fourier components at the lower frequency range, which would explain the insensitivity of the spectral response to the application of the high-cut filter. This interpretation can be confirmed by calculating the oscillator response using only the Fourier components of the total response in different frequency ranges transformed into the time domain. In other words, in the bottom row of Figure 5, rather than applying the Inverse FFT to the entire suite of Fourier components, we can use only the components from specified frequency intervals to see if these are still able to capture the total response. The frequency intervals selected are  $0.03 - 1.0\mathrm{Hz}$ ,  $1 - 10\mathrm{Hz}$ , and  $10 - 100\mathrm{Hz}$ , the upper limit being the Nyquist frequency of the record. Figure 7 shows comparisons between the oscillator response using the full suite of Fourier components, from both the mean-removed and filtered accelerograms, and the response obtained using only the components from the three frequency intervals identified above. It is immediately apparent that in both cases the oscillator response is almost entirely dominated by the components in the  $1 - 10\mathrm{Hz}$  range, very remote from the filter cut-off at  $50\mathrm{Hz}$ , which explains the insensitivity of this spectral ordinate to the filter. Another interesting observation can be made comparing the left- and right-hand plots in Figure 6 for the mean-removed record, which shows how the oscillator

response effectively attenuates the ground-motion contributions from frequencies higher than the oscillator frequency, even if it locally amplifies them.

The main conclusion from Figures 6 and 7 is that if the local amplifications around the oscillator frequency are exceeded by other (lower) frequency components, then the high-cut filter will not exert a large influence on the high-frequency spectral ordinates. This can be illustrated with another example (Figure 8), this time looking at the response of an oscillator with a natural frequency  $(50\mathrm{Hz})$  much higher than the filter cut-off applied to the record  $(30\mathrm{Hz})$ . The recording in this case is also from a moderate magnitude earthquake and obtained at a stiff soil site at some distance  $(61\mathrm{km})$  from the fault rupture. Figure 8 shows the same information as in Figures 6 and 7 for the previous record, except that only the isolated components from the range of  $1 - 10\mathrm{Hz}$  are considered. The Fourier components plot shows that while the mean-removed record does produce a local maximum at the oscillator frequency, for both records the frequency components at much lower frequencies are significantly higher. The lower plots in Figure 8 confirm that the oscillator response can be reproduced almost exactly using only the components from the  $1 - 10\mathrm{Hz}$  frequency range. This is an interesting result that once more undermines any assumption of symmetry between high- and low-frequency behavior: whereas no legitimate scheme would allow the use of spectral ordinates at periods beyond the low-cut corner period, in this case we see that we can confidently use the spectral ordinate at a response period that is just over half of the low-period filter cut-off.

Looking now at an example of a case where the high-cut filter does have a marked influence on the high-frequency spectral ordinates, Figure 9 shows the same information as Figure 8 but for a stiff site  $(V_{\mathrm{s30}} = 720\mathrm{m / s})$  recording obtained at  $32\mathrm{km}$  from a small-magnitude earthquake. The high-cut filter was applied at  $30\mathrm{Hz}$  on the basis of the relatively flat shape of the FAS at higher frequencies. The figure examines the response of an oscillator with a natural frequency  $(33\mathrm{Hz})$  slightly greater than the filter cut-off. The Fourier components plot shows that the response to the

![](images/76221411ae48d23d56c6fbde3f2fd6a5476084f3075b56d605d5d56a5d0dd0d8.jpg)

Lower: Comparison of oscillator response using the full range of Fourier components of the response (black) with the oscillator response using only the components in the  $20 - 50\mathrm{Hz}$  frequency interval for the mean-removed record and in the  $1 - 20\mathrm{Hz}$  interval for the filtered record, which in each case largely reproduce the total response. (The procedure applied to Figure 7 for the scaling of time axes of the oscillator response plots also applies here.)

mean-removed record is dominated by frequencies close to the oscillator frequency. The response from the filtered record, as can be seen in the lower plots, is significantly smaller and is driven by the Fourier components in the range of  $1 - 20\mathrm{Hz}$ . This result is entirely consistent with the conclusion of Douglas and Boore [8] which can be interpreted as the decreasing influence of the high-cut filter with the ratio between the peak on the FAS and the level of high-frequency noise. Whereas for the records in Figures 7 and 8 this ratio is higher than 2 orders of magnitude, in Figure 9 the ratio is much smaller and as a consequence the short-period spectral ordinates are strongly affected by the application of a high-cut filter. In such a case, the spectral ordinates at frequencies close to the filter cut-off should not be used.

The cases presented so far suggest that the use of the ratio of the peak of the FAS to the average level of the high-frequency noise proposed by Douglas and Boore [8] could provide a tool for identifying, a priori, those records for which high-cut filtering could be expected to exert a strong influence on the short-period response spectral ordinates. Such a tool would be enormously useful since no consistent patterns (in terms of earthquake, station or even instrument characteristics) emerge in the data that would serve as a simple guide to identify records likely to be insensitive or otherwise to high-cut filtering. However, some cases are found where the FAS ratio from peak to high-frequency noise level is large but nonetheless the short-period spectral ordinates are strongly influenced by the application of a high-cut filter. Such a case is shown in Figure 10, which shows information similar to the preceding figures but for a rock site recording from a digital instrument located at  $15\mathrm{km}$  from a small-magnitude event. The oscillator response is  $50\mathrm{Hz}$ , a little higher than the high-cut corner frequency of  $40\mathrm{Hz}$ . While the peak in the FAS is high in comparison to the noise level, the Fourier component of the response is high around the oscillator frequency, and

although there are slightly higher components (at about  $5 - 7\mathrm{Hz}$ ) the high-frequency components make a significant contribution to the total response. For this reason, as can be appreciated from the lower plots, the application of the high-cut filter leads to a marked reduction of the short-period spectral ordinates; the ratio of the spectral accelerations from the filtered and mean-removed records is just 0.69 at this response frequency.

# 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Examination of the newly extended European strong-motion database reveals a lack of any consistently reliable criteria for identifying the degree to which the short-period spectral ordinates from different records will be altered by the high-cut filter. We therefore opted to look at the simple statistics of the response spectra ratios of the filtered to mean-removed records at several short response periods for both the horizontal and vertical components (Figure 11). Before discussing these statistical results we must note that the presented probability distributions serve to show the

Figure 11.

The probabilities above each column correspond to ratios being between 0.9 and 1.1.

accumulation of the bulk of the ratio data and they are not used in the decision criteria set for determining the usable spectral ordinates at the short-period end of the spectrum.

The first interesting observation from these plots is that the probability distributions are rather narrow in all the cases, and very narrow for  $0.1\mathrm{s}$ . The vertical spectral accelerations are clearly more sensitive to the high-cut filters than the horizontal, as would be expected since the vertical components of motion are generally of much higher frequency content. For the horizontal components, taking spectral ratios for which the ordinate of the filtered record does not differ by more than  $10\%$  from that of the mean-removed record, at all of these periods there is a probability of at least  $93\%$  of the records being acceptable. This is at  $0.02\mathrm{s}$  whereas at other periods, including, interestingly, 0.01 and  $0.0\mathrm{s}$  (PGA), the probabilities are higher, and mostly in excess of  $95\%$ . The relatively lower sensitivity of the spectral ordinates to the filter cut-off at very short response periods can be understood from the middle row of Figure 5 and the shape of the oscillator response, which will nearly always lead to the response at very high frequencies being driven by much lower frequency components. For very short response periods, the oscillator frequency will generally be in the decaying part of the Fourier spectrum and even with a local amplification at this frequency, the response will be dominated by components at lower frequencies and the influence of any higher frequencies will be strongly attenuated by the oscillator itself.

Our recommendation, and the approach that we adopt for the European strong-motion database, is to simply remove those records for which the spectral ordinate of the filtered record differs by more than  $10\%$  from that of the mean-removed record. In view of the fact that the number of

Figure 12. Distribution of the expanded European strong-motion dataset in terms of magnitude, distance and site classification for (a) horizontal components retained after high-cut filtering and (b) horizontal components rejected after high-cut filtering, and for (c) vertical components retained after high-cut filtering and (d) vertical components rejected after high-cut filtering.

records failing the criterion (of falling in the range of spectral ratios from 0.9 to 1.1) does not reduce monotonically with period—contrary to the decay observed at long periods—rather than using different numbers of records for regressions at each of these high frequencies, our proposal is to remove completely from the regressions those records failing the criterion at any period between 0.01 and  $0.05\mathrm{s}$ . For the horizontal component, this means that the discarded records are largely controlled by the performance at  $0.02\mathrm{s}$ , although a few additional records fall out because they fail the criterion at other response periods. Figure 12 shows the distributions of horizontal and vertical records surviving and failing this criterion. Histogram plots in Figures 13 and 14 compare the number of rejected horizontal and vertical records with the total number of accelerograms in the database in terms of distance, magnitude and recording instrument (i.e. digital vs analogue waveforms). These plots support the conclusion drawn previously that there are no consistent groupings of the records that are most affected by the high-cut filters in terms of magnitude, distance or waveform quality. It is also noteworthy that the rejected records are not exclusively from rock sites (Figure 12). About  $9\%$  of the horizontal components are rejected, more or less evenly distributed among the three site classes, and  $14.5\%$  of the vertical components, the latter belonging more predominantly to soil sites. There are 2544 horizontal pairs of components that remain after the application of high-cut filtering, and 2371 vertical components. From Figures 12-14 it can be discerned that there is no perfect correlation between the horizontal and vertical components

eliminated as a result of the high-cut filter, with the result that the number of records remaining for studies of the vertical-to-horizontal ratio, for example, is appreciably smaller (just below 2000). However, these numbers and the distributions shown in Figure 12 suggest that European GMPEs could very easily be extended to periods smaller than the  $0.05\mathrm{~s~}$  limit that has been currently imposed; Akkar and Bommer [24] present coefficients for spectral accelerations at short response periods to complement the predictions of spectral ordinates between 0.05 and  $3.0\mathrm{~s~}$  presented by Akkar and Bommer [16].
